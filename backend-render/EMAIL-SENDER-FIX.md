# 🎯 Email Sender Name Fix - Solved!

## ❌ **The Problem**
Before the fix, all mention notifications showed:
```
From: StudyBuddy <editwithsanjay@gmail.com>
```

**Even when Alice mentioned Bob**, the email looked like it came from "StudyBuddy" instead of Alice.

---

## ✅ **The Solution**
Now mention notifications show:
```
From: Alice (StudyBuddy) <editwithsanjay@gmail.com>
From: Bob (StudyBuddy) <editwithsanjay@gmail.com>
From: Charlie (StudyBuddy) <editwithsanjay@gmail.com>
```

**The actual chat user's name appears as the sender** while keeping your Gmail for authentication.

---

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### Before (notifications.js):
```js
const mailOptions = {
  from: `"StudyBuddy" <${EMAIL_USER}>`,  // Always "StudyBuddy"
  to: recipientEmail,
  subject: subject,
  text: textContent,
  html: htmlContent,
};
```

### After (notifications.js):
```js
const mailOptions = {
  from: `"${mentionedByName} (StudyBuddy)" <${EMAIL_USER}>`,  // Shows actual sender
  to: recipientEmail,
  subject: subject,
  text: textContent,
  html: htmlContent,
};
```

## 📧 **Real Example**

When **Alice** mentions **Bob** in the chat:

### Email Headers:
- **From:** `Alice (StudyBuddy) <editwithsanjay@gmail.com>`
- **To:** `bob@example.com`
- **Subject:** `You were mentioned in Study Room - StudyBuddy`

### Email Content:
```
📚 StudyBuddy
